I've been reading a lot about aerospace engineering recently. Everything from textbooks, to articles, to wikipedia. Anything I can get my hands on to be honest and what I've gathered, coming from my humble background in math and physics, is that aerospace engineers &mdash; are f*%!$ing insane.

I don't know what I was expecting from a field founded on the idea of making things that fly but here I am. Take, for example, the X-15 project. 

- X-15
- LACE
- Project Pluto
- Scratch that. all of the X planes
- Skylon???
